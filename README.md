# My First Project Game

Welcome to **My First Project Game**! 🎮  
This is a simple and fun browser-based game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was created as my first project in game development and web programming.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of the game is to overcome obstacles and see how far you've come.

It's lightweight, easy to play, and runs entirely in the browser—no downloads required!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the game
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the following controls to play:

```
[Example Controls]
- W = To go forward
- S = To go backwards
- D = To go left
- A = To go right

```
